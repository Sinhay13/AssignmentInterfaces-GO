File Reader

This is a Go program that reads the contents of a file and prints them to the terminal.

Usage

To use this program, run the following command:

$ go run main.go <filename>

Code Overview

The program consists of three functions:

main(): This function gets the filename from the command-line arguments, creates a name object from it, and calls the printContent() function with the name object as an argument.

openAndReadFile(): This method is defined for the name type and opens the file with the name of the object, reads its contents using a bufio.Reader, and returns the contents of the file as a string and any error that occurred while reading the file.

printContent(): This function calls the openAndReadFile() method on the file object and prints the contents of the file to the terminal. If there is an error while reading the file, it prints the error message instead.

The program also defines an interface file that has a method openAndReadFile() that returns a string and an error, and a type name that is a string.

The program imports the bufio, fmt, io, and os packages for reading files, printing to the terminal, handling file I/O, and accessing command-line arguments and files, respectively.
